# Why we included flash minting in our ethereum version
To discourage bad smart contract designs, and make dividends-paying EUBI tokens more useful, we implemented zero-intrest unlimited flash minting. Infinite zero-intrest flash minting can also be used for good purpuses, such as collateral swapping, self-liquidation, and capital-free arbitrage. Infinite zero-intrest flash minting allows minting more than 115 octodecillion EUBI tokens on the condition that the minted tokens are burned in the same transaction.

Flash minting discourages bad smart contract designs, enabling flash loan attacks, which are previously only possible if done by whales. The "you need 1 million/billion/trillion EUBI to trigger this smart contract bug" BS is invalidated by the zero-intrest infinite flash minting capability. It's a common misconception that flash loans weaken DeFi, since those attacks are already possible for crypto whales. Instead, they strengthen DeFi by weeding out those poorly-designed protocols with extremely bad programming practices.
